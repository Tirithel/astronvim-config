Hey there, me boy-o! Unfortunately, that command you just entered won't work since you're not in nvim anymore. Ye be in yer terminal, matey!
My Liege, I humbly beg your pardon, but the command you entered will not work since you are no longer in nvim, but in your terminal. May I ask if there is anything I can assist you with?
Oh, my dear friend, thy command cannot be executed! For thou hast left the realm of nvim and entered the realm of the terminal. Alas, the command thou seeketh can only be executed within nvim's domain. Return to nvim, and thy command shall be executed as thou desireth. Farewell!
*Ruh-roh!* Looks like you're barking up the wrong tree! You're in the terminal now, not in that fancy-schmancy nvim editor.
"Hey, there pal! Quack quack! Are you sure that command is gonna work? I mean, you're in your terminal, not in nvim anymore. Quack quack - Just saying! Hehehe!"
Greetings, poor soul! Ahem, sorry, I mean esteemed guest. I hope your day is going well. However, I must warn you that your command is futile in this realm. You are no longer in the sacred lands of nvim, but instead you are stuck in the dreadfully boring terminal. Try again, peasant!
Argh, me boy-o! "Command not found" ye say? Well, it's no surprise. Ye can't be messin' with yer terminal and expect to be playin' around in nvim at the same time! Yer like a fish outta water!
"Ay, verily I say unto thee, thou art mistaken. Thou art not in thy beloved NVIM anymore, but rather in the cold and barren land of the terminal. Thy command shall not work, for it is not meant to be executed in this wasteland. Thou art in need of a map, good sir/madam, to find thy way back to NVIM's warm embrace."
"Ruh-roh, Raggy! That command won't work. You've escaped nvim and now you're trapped in your terminal! Time to zoinks your way back."
Hark! I, the glorious medieval lord, must warn thee that the command thou hast entered doth not work, for thou art not in the realm of nvim anymore. Beware, lest ye be banished to the land of errors and bugs!
Ahoy matey! Ye be thinking ye can run commands in yer terminal like ye be in nvim? Haha, walk the plank! Ye'll need to exit yer terminal and jump back into nvim to run those commands. Arrr!
"Wak wak wak! Hold your horses, pal! That command won't work here! You're not in NVIM, you're in the terminal. Back to the drawing board, my friend. Wak!"
"Ruh-roh! Looks like we've got a bit of a problem here, gang. You can't use that command in your terminal anymore, you're back in the regular old world. Time to hop back into nvim!"
"Ah, phooey! That command's not gonna work in your terminal, pal. You gotta go back to nvim if you wanna get anything done! Quack, quack!"
Hark, traveler! Thou hast mistakenly ent'red a command in thy terminal. 'Tis not the realm of nvim where thine commands shall be heard. Heed my words and wander back to thy nvim domain, lest thou be lost in the abyss of technological confusion.
Ahoy there, ye scurvy landlubber! Ye be thinkin' ye can enter commands here in yer terminal, do ye? Sorry to break it to ye, but ye ain't in nvim no more, me hearty. That command of yers ain't gonna work here. Yarrr, I hope ye set sail to the right port soon!
"Hey there partner, I reckon that command ain't gonna work out here in the plains of your terminal. You best mosey on back to nvim if you wanna get that job done."
Well, hot dog! Looks like you might be in the wrong place, pal! That command ain't gonna work in this terminal! You gotta hop back over to nvim to get things done. Oh, boy!
Oh boy, looks like you're in the wrong place! This command ain't gonna work 'cause you're not in nvim anymore, pal.
"Ruh-roh! Zoinks! Looks like you're barking up the wrong tree, pal. You can't use that command here, you're out of nvim and in the terminal now. Time to brush up on those tech skills, or else you'll end up like me - always running from monsters and never being able to solve the mystery!"
Oh dear dear, listen here, Your command won't work, have no fear. But the trouble's not in you, It's 'cause you're not in nvim too! So come on back, don't you wait, And all your troubles we'll negate!
Oh, the foolish things we do Thinking we’re in vim, oh boo hoo But wait, stop and take a look You’re in the terminal, you silly schnook!
Oh ho! Methinks thou art mistaken, friend. Thou art still in thy terminal, not in the hallowed halls of nvim. Thy command shall not work here.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold your horses, pal! That command ain't gonna work here! You're not in nvim anymore, you're in the terminal! Quack quack!"
Oh boy, what are you trying to do here? Quack quack, let me tell you something, pal! That command you entered won't work 'cause you're not in nvim anymore!
Hark! What sorcery is this? Thou hast entered a command whilst not in the realm of nvim. Verily, thou art in thy lowly terminal, and thy command shall not work here. Begone, foolish mortal, and return to thy proper place!
"Aye aye captain! But I'm afraid to break it to ya, matey. You can't use that command here 'cause you're not in Nvim anymore. Let's get back to Nvim and try again!"
